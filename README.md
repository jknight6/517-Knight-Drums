This repository is to talk about drums and some of my favorite drummers.

Drums are more complicated than people might initially think. There are lots of factors that influence both the quality of a drum and the type of music it performs best for. Some of those factors include:

- Shell type (wood vs metal vs acrylic)
- Drumheads (material and tuning)
- Hardware (lugs, rims, and overall craftsmanship)
- Playing technique (strike point, dynamics, and drumsticks)

## Wood Types for Drums

Different woods are used for drums because the material significantly impacts the drum's tone, resonance, and sustain by influencing the shell's density, porosity, and grain. Here are some of the wood types used for drums, and some of the effects they have on drum performance:

### Maple

Very versatile and popular, maple wood is balanced and consistent in tone.

### Birch

Popular for recording because its hardness delivers a focused, bright tone that projects well.

### Mahogany

Known for its warmth and bass resonance, used for vintage sounds and deep bass.

### Ash

Popular for rock music due to its brightness and great high-end tones.

### Poplar

Most affordable wood that offers a mellow tone, used in budget drum kits but not ideal for high quality performance or recording.

## My Top 3 Drummers

3. Stewart Copeland (The Police)

Copeland is best known for finding ways to be subtle and aggressive at the same time. He made a relatively small drum kit seem massive with his wide fills, and seemed allergic to snare-based playing. I love the passion he brings to the kit, and the energy that infuses every song he's on.

2. Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree, King Crimson, Pineapple Thief)

As a prog rock drummer, Harrison is an exceptionally technical drummer and has played with many bands throughout his career. I love his underemphasized style that makes it difficult for an untuned ear to fully recognize just how difficult what he plays is. While I am not a prog rock drummer, listening to him play motivated me to keep improving and find joy in the instrument.

3. Neil Peart (Rush)

Peart is probably the most air-drummed-to drummer of all time. If you have heard _Tom Sawyer_, you know why. His massive drum set is iconic, his air tight fills make your hairs stand up, and it's hard to listen to him play without wanting to hop on the set and play until your hands are calloused.
